title: How to build the package
---

To build the `spark_map` package, you need to first, clone the repository to your machine (with `git clone`), and change to the root directory of the project (with `cd`):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pedropark99/spark_map.git
cd spark_map
```

After that, you use the standard `build` command for python packages. As a result, a `dist` folder will be created in the current directory, and the compiled files for the package will be inside of it.

```bash
# If you are in windows
py -m build
# If you are in MacOs/Linux
python3 -m build
```
